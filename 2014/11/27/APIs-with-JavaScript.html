    <h1 class="post-title">APIs with JavaScript</h1>
    <p class="post-meta">Nov 27, 2014</p>
  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Finals just ended yesterday with my CS1101S paper, and I dare say it was quite manageable.</p>

<p>Here’s what I learnt today, using APIs with JavaScript.</p>

<p>First of all, we all have to learn about <strong>HTTP</strong> before we talk anything about web programming.<!---excerpt-break--></p>

<h2 id="http-hypertext-transfer-protocol">HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol</h2>

<p>HTTP is actually a set of rules for getting something from one place to another. So what are these ‘places’?</p>

<p>They are split into two types:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Servers: Other computers on the Internet</li>
  <li>Clients: That’s us.</li>
</ol>

<p>So when a <em>HTTP request</em> is made, the request zips through the Internet until it finds the right server to handle that <em>request</em>. Then the server would send the <em>response</em> back to you.</p>

<p>I’ll mention more about this <em>request/response</em> later on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Client/Server relationship is a prerequisite of a set of principles called Representational State Transfer (REST)</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>What this means is that every link clicked on the webpage would result in a <em>state transition</em>. Means it simply brings you to the next page, representing the current <em>state</em> of the application.</p>

<p>When an application or webpage follow this type of <em>page-to-page</em> navigation, we start to follow the <em>REST principles</em>. And we call these applications <strong>RESTful</strong>. (Finally, this term that is so commonly seen makes sense)</p>

<p>Right, so we got all of that HTTP stuff settled, let’s move on to find out what are <em>APIs</em> (yet another commonly heard name all over the Internet)</p>

<h2 id="api-application-programming-interface">API: Application Programming Interface</h2>

<p>In English, <em>APIs</em> specifies the ways a program can interact with an application.</p>

<p>We mentioned about <em>RESTful applications</em> above, so for an API to be RESTful, it must fulfil certain criterias:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It has to seperate the <em>client</em> from the <em>server</em></li>
  <li>It cannot <em>hold state</em> between requests: meaning no information is stored by server from request to request</li>
  <li>It has to use <em>HTTP</em> and <em>HTTP methods</em></li>
</ol>

<p>(There are many other criterias, but for now, these would do)</p>

<p>Right, I mentioned that I’ll talk more about <em>request/response</em></p>

<h2 id="making-a-request">Making a REQUEST</h2>

<p>Here’s the code sample for making a request:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">xhr</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">XMLHttpRequest</span><span class="p">();</span>

<span class="nx">xhr</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'GET'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'www.blah.com'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kc">false</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="nx">xhr</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">send</span><span class="p">();</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Before I go into what these means, we have to know the four verbs of HTTP methods:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>GET</strong>: <em>retrieves</em> information form specified source</li>
  <li><strong>POST</strong>: <em>sends</em> new information to specified source</li>
  <li><strong>PUT</strong>: <em>updates</em> exisiting information to specified source</li>
  <li><strong>DELETE</strong>: <em>removes</em> existing information from specified source</li>
</ol>

<p>These are methods are named really intuitively, I like it.</p>

<p>Now let’s go into the code:</p>

<p>First, <code class="highlighter-rouge">xhr</code> stores a new <code class="highlighter-rouge">XMLHttpRequest</code> object, and this object contains various methods.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">open</code> defines the request, first parameter being the HTTP verb that you’re about to execute, followed by the server, then here’s the last parameter which I still understand quite vaguely. <code class="highlighter-rouge">false</code> means that this function will wait until it gets a response from the server. I’ll read more on this.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">send</code> will then… you guessed it, send the reqeust.</p>

<p>Within xhr, it will contain certain information about the request. <code class="highlighter-rouge">console.log(xhr.statusCode);</code> will return you the status code of the HTTP request. 
<strong>TODO</strong>: Read up more about these methods that <code class="highlighter-rouge">xhr</code> contain.</p>

<h2 id="parsing-the-response">Parsing the Response</h2>

<p>There are two types of responses that the API can return you. Either <em>XML</em> or <em>JSON</em>. Read the docs to find out which one the API is providing! So here’s what the response will contain:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Response line: three-digit HTTP code, I wouldn’t write them down here since they are easily ‘Google-able’.</li>
  <li>Header: this contains further information about server and its response.</li>
  <li>Body: basically, either <em>XML</em> or <em>JSON</em></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Parsing XML</strong></p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">xmldoc</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">xhr</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">responseXML</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>With the above code, <code class="highlighter-rouge">xmldoc</code> now contains the XML returned by the server.</p>

<p>XML stands for E<strong>x</strong>tensible <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage. It’s like HTML, but with all sorts of tags that you create yourself. Now that you have xmldoc, you could easily access items in the response body by applying methods/accessing members of <code class="highlighter-rouge">xmldoc</code>. Still have to read up more about this.</p>

<p>On the other hand…</p>

<p>JSON stands for <strong>J</strong>ava<strong>S</strong>cript <strong>O</strong>bject <strong>N</strong>otation. It’s exactly how you would create a new anonymous JavaScript object.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">new_obj</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="na">a</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="na">b</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="na">c</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">3</span>
<span class="p">};</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>in JSON would be…</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="s2">"a"</span><span class="err">:</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="s2">"b"</span><span class="err">:</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="s2">"c"</span><span class="err">:</span> <span class="mi">3</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I’ve read somewhere that there is no such thing as <code class="highlighter-rouge">responseJSON</code> method for <code class="highlighter-rouge">XMLHttpRequest</code> object, only <code class="highlighter-rouge">responseText</code>. So if the response is not in XML, it should be stored as <code class="highlighter-rouge">responseText</code>. In that case, <code class="highlighter-rouge">var jsonDoc = xhr.responseText;</code> would return you the JSON response body. (I’ll correct this if it’s wrong)</p>

<p>That’s about all that I learnt for APIs with JavaScript. Most of it was from <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/courses/javascript-beginner-en-EID4t/0/1">this</a> course here by Codecademy. Really learnt quite a bit, despite playing around with APIs for quite a while. I’ll <strong>definitely</strong> be playing around with a few APIs over the semester break, and let’s see how much can I do with it. :)</p>

<p>Hope to keep this learning streak going!</p>
