NUSMods provide a better way for students to plan their school timetables.
Over time, more features have been added to improve the lives of NUS students.
Besides timetable planning, NUSMods also serves to be a complete knowledge bank
of NUS courses by providing useful course-related information such as archived
CORS bidding statistics and community-driven course reviews and discussions.

I used to be a contributor, and is currently a maintainer of this open source project.
