I am a senior undergraduate in Computer Science at National University of
Singapore.

My interests lies in **Artificial Intelligence** and **Software Engineering**.
I dabble in a lot of **Python** and **JavaScript**.

I am an awardee of the Industry Preparation for Pre-graduate (iPREP)
programme by iDA. I am also currently enrolled under the von Neumann
Programme (vNP) in the NUS School of Computing.

I have also successfully completed the **NUS Overseas College** programme, a
year long internship programme in Silicon Valley, while taking evening
classes at **Stanford Center for Professional Development** at the same time.

Currently, I am working on my final year research thesis, exploring
implementations of **Deep Learning on FPGAs**.

#### TIDBITS...

I used to be a **Cadet Inspector** in the **National Police Cadet Corps**,
inspiring youth leaders in secondary schools. I also served in the **Singapore
Armed Forces** as an **artilleryman** for 2 years before matriculating in
University.

During my free time, I enjoy swimming, basketball, and occasionally flaunting
my very limited musical flair on the electric guitar and piano.

I'm also an avid lover of musicals, Hamilton, Wicked, and Les Miserables are
some of my favorites. :)
