  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I like to reflect on what I’ve done, what I should’ve done, and what I plan
to do at a certain milestone. Besides, I just gave my mid-term presentation and
my thoughts are still fresh. Time flies really quickly, but I feel it is
important to spend time to look back. I wouldn’t want to risk wasting another
6 more months, only to leave the Valley with regrets.</p>

<!---excerpt-break-->

<p>I settled in pretty comfortably into my situation, and came to accept that
most of the time, <em>I cannot control the cards I’m dealt with, but I can change
the way I play them</em>. Coming to Silicon Valley with high expectations of
what a fast growing startup should be (thank you ShopBack), I was a little
disappointed with what I experienced. (Shall not name my company here, although
it isn’t hard to find out)</p>

<p><strong>It is not a bad company, but it is a mature company that does not require
any more backend interns.</strong></p>

<p>Also, the problem with having a remote team is the difference in quality of
work, and the lack of useful work. As a result, most of my time spent are on
simple little projects that doesn’t seem to matter to anyone that much.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I enjoy writing code that leaves a positive impact on people’s lives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I clearly did not enjoy myself, but I did perform my duties to the best of my
abilities. Perhaps I should have come in with lower expectations of what I can
learn, but that sounds <em>really pessimistic</em>.</p>

<p>So I did lower my expectations, and made some difference in the way I
approached things. Like Ben said, I’m <em>“trying to create life in a lifeless
land”</em>. I’m sure it is not that extreme, I tried looking for new ways to find
important work.</p>

<p>Adapting to my situation here has made me look at things from a different POV.
I would definitely like my situation to be better than what it is right now,
but I shall not complain, because doing so will only take away more time from
the things that actually matter.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-are-the-things-that-matter-in-the-next-half">So what are the things that matter in the next half?</h2>

<p>I’ve broken them down into three categories:
<strong>academics, New Venture Creation</strong>, and <strong>personal development</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="academics">Academics</h3>

<p>I missed out on taking a CS module in Stanford for my first half, missing out
on a very rare opportunity. Also, going on a year long internship would mean
too long a break from school, and to gain back the rigor that academia
provides, I need to treat my Stanford courses seriously next quarter.</p>

<p>Machine Learning is on the top of my list, since it will be taught by the
famous Dr Andrew Ng, followed by several Coursera courses such as
Cryptography. Also, relearning Computer Networking is something I had always
wanted to do, since NUS did not really do a good job in teaching me what I had
to know about Networking. Udacity offers a really good course in it, and I’ll
see what I can learn from it.</p>

<p>Hopefully these courses will allow me to gain back my ability to perform in an
academic environment before I return to Singapore.</p>

<h3 id="new-venture-creation-nvc">New Venture Creation (NVC)</h3>

<p>This is a module that we all have to do. Come up with a business model and
build a working prototype. Originally I thought this felt very much like
CS3216. But I eventually came to a realisation that in CS3216, we were
encouraged to build an idea that is simply <em>cool</em>. NVC pushes us to make the
idea <em>profitable</em> and <em>fundable</em>.</p>

<p><em>Cool</em> and <em>profitable</em> rarely coexist.</p>

<p>I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB3Wd00fL3s">this video</a> by Jack Ma
recently and it really inspired me. It emphasizes the Chinese value of
‘honor’, and how it can be applied to impact the world.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a businessman, the most important decision to determine a company’s
destiny has nothing to do with money.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This has inspired me for my own NVC: <strong>think of building something that really
has an impact on the world, rather than being just profit-making</strong>. I doubt
many would agree with my overly optimistic point-of-view, since most companies
of such nature close down due to lack of money.</p>

<h3 id="personal-development">Personal Development</h3>

<p>I’ve bought several books that I wish to finish before I head home. These are
books that stimulate my mind, brings me out of my own little bubble of
software development and broadens my view on certain aspects of life. I do
wish to write a few book reviews about what I read, and share them on this
blog.</p>

<p>Also, joining a proper gym training programme would be on my list as well. I’m
guilty of not utilizing my 24-Hour Fitness membership. I head to the gym when
I feel like it, not on a <em>very</em> regular basis. A personal trainer programme
would probably help me solve that problem.</p>

<p>It has dawned upon me that my hunger for learning isn’t as strong as what it
used to be. Going onto different platforms to learn, and learn fast. That is
what I should be doing in my free time, rather than lazing around. It scares me
how quickly time flies past when I’m lying down on my bed with my mobile phone
on social media.</p>

<p>I’ve signed up for more courses on Udacity, and Coursera to further broaden my
skillsets, and dive deeper into certain areas.</p>

<p>This is my plan for the next half, and I hope I’ll achieve what I set out for
before I leave. I need to trigger the hunger for knowledge, and satisfy them
with the wide array of resources that I have at hand.</p>

<hr />

<p>**Note that I did not include <em>level up as a developer</em>. It is a given that I
will always strive to level up as a craftsman. I practise my craft everyday
extensively, exposing myself to many new technologies and concepts. That being
said, it is also time to dive in on how things work, rather than simply knowing
how to glue things together from a higher level.</p>
