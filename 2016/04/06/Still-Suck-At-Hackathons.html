  <article class="post-content">
    <p>It’s been almost a year since I’ve written. I have grown pretty much as a
developer, and as a person. It has been a really fruitful journey
from developing Letterbox to making my way here in Silicon Valley, and I am
thankful for every part of it.</p>

<p>Recently I took part in a Bitcoin hackathon organised by Berkeley, and realised
that I still suck at these competitions. There is a constant stress and
pressure on me, with or without teammates. Being the only developer (I joined
with Regina) on the team, there are many expectations to be met.</p>

<p>Here are a few lessons learnt: <!---excerpt-break--></p>

<h2 id="dont-overestimate-my-abilities">Don’t overestimate my abilities</h2>

<p>It first started off with playing around with Facebook’s Relay and GraphQL
together with React Native, and slowly turned into just playing with React
Native, with a very quick Flask setup.</p>

<p>The thought of putting together a polished, working and quality mobile app
within a night by myself shouldn’t even have appeared in my head. Maybe if I
had another developer working with me, I could delegate and somewhat come up
with a polished product.</p>

<p>I overestimate my abilities too easily. Remember NUSHello? Yeah, that was a
<strong>total disaster</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="when-working-with-something-new-read-and-expose-myself-extensively">When working with something new, read and expose myself extensively</h2>

<p>I was working with React Native for the first time and I did not realize that
Redux could work well with it. I would imagine the ease of simply implementing
reducers, and calling actions. However this did not come into my mind and I
ended up passing props all over the place in Vanilla React.</p>

<p>This could have easily been avoided by reading, and Googling up about things
like that instead of jumping in.</p>

<p>But to be fair, I was totally bummed out. It was 12am when I started work on
the client and it was a total mess.</p>

<h2 id="find-teammates">Find teammates</h2>

<p>I should stop thinking I can do things all by myself. Working with people
is essential in winning hackathons and I need to open myself up to working
with people more often.</p>

<h2 id="if-all-else-fails-invision-is-my-best-friend">If all else fails, Invision is my best friend</h2>

<p>Regina could design, and I could simply hook them all up with Invision and
pitch with the prototype. But, instead of doing that we slept in and did not
even return to the demo pitch. What a waste.</p>

<p><strong>Always pitch next time!</strong></p>

<p>It was still a great great great experience overall since it was my first time
messing around with mobile development, and I must say that React Native made
things really easy to understand.</p>

<p>The idea I have in mind shall not be shared in this blog because I would love
to polish it further before revealing any details about it. :)</p>

<p>Oh and did I mention, Google Code Jam is back. Let’s go solve some algorithm
puzzles!</p>
