The question was &#8220;Tell me more about yourself.&#8221;Â </p>\n<p>&#8220;Hi, I&#8217;m Bili&#8221; was my response. *major facepalm* (Yes, I got rejected)</p>\n<p>Tomorrow is going to be another interview, for NUS University Scholar&#8217;s Programme. I&#8217;ve learnt my lesson to prepare for interviews, and I sure did this time. More importantly, I believe confidence is the key to scoring during an interview. Walk into that room, and show the interviewers that you&#8217;re merely having a chat with them about something you really like talking about. So here are my codeÂ for tomorrow&#8217;s interview, which is about the same as my code for university life.Â </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Be yourself, be free, have fun &amp; dominate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, the last part is the crucial. I don&#8217;t wish to leave the room the same way I did after my first job interview, embarrassed and filled with regrets. This time it&#8217;s going to be different.Â </p>\n<p>That said, it&#8217;s fine if I don&#8217;t get an offer from USP. This entire process of essay-writing to interview has given me experience that I need for my future endeavours. Hopefully the interview would be productive and fruitful tomorrow, instead of only just a process that I have to go through.</p>\n<p><em>I will learn and grow as a person, even if I don&#8217;t get in.Â </em>That&#8217;s the ulterior motive.Â </p>\n<p>I&#8217;m all set, hopefully tomorrow will be without a hitch! ðŸ™‚</p>\n","date":"2014-04-29T13:40:46.000Z"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"interviews-i-never-had-a-problem-with-them"}}}
