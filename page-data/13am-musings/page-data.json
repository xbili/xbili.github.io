It was an easy paper, I thought I had it in the bag&#8230;</p>\n<p><strong>But I clearly did not.</strong></p>\n<p>Whenever things start to veer into the direction of hard work not paying off, I think it&#8217;s good to reflect on quality of work. Perhaps I did not grasp the concept well enough or it was just plain bad luck. There&#8217;s no harm in reflecting either way.</p>\n<p>The semester has been very hectic so far. Starting off with the Inter College Games and two hackathons, it is now week 9 and I don&#8217;t feel confident about my work at all. The algorithms class is the most interesting course I have this semester, but I am not thriving in it. The first half of linear algebra is also supposed to be easy to grasp, but I (most likely) made too many careless mistakes in the midterm paper.</p>\n<p>In addition to school work, I have my own projects such as Google Summer of Code applications and CS1010R to juggle. It is demanding and painful, but I do believe that I am leveling up as a person.</p>\n<p>This got brought up during a conversation with a friend:</p>\n<blockquote><p>You do know there is more than just getting a degree and running the rat race right?</p></blockquote>\n<p>This should be one of the most important lesson that I have yet to learn. It&#8217;s still early, I am still in my freshman year. But I acknowledge the fact that the earlier I understand this, <em>the closer I am to really benefiting from university education. </em></p>\n","date":"2015-03-19T16:44:53.000Z"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"13am-musings"}}}
