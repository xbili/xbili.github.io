A series of events happened and I really feel bad about the way I took it in my stride.</p>\n<p>First of all, midterm results were not satisfactory. I performed slightly below average for both papers. Given that I only had two papers to prepare for, this was a total letdown.</p>\n<p><em>Seriously, I had a week to prepare for two papers and I performed lower than par for both?</em></p>\n<p>Next up would be the preparations for technical interviews. Having done a summer of software engineering, my algorithmic thinking skills have more or less degraded. It&#8217;s true that the foundation from CS2020 will get me back up to speed in no time, but I should keep in mind to do some algorithm exercises every once in a while to warm myself up again.</p>\n<p>Lastly, I have serious issues with my CS2105 assignments. 50% for the first assignment because I submitted it with the wrong file name, while another 50% gone because I used some boilerplate code online for the second assignment. I got 2 more assignments to go and hopefully it will go better than the first 2.</p>\n<p>Why do I write posts like these every once in a while? It probably makes me feel that I am doing some reflection on my life, and to some extent make myself feel better about the situation I&#8217;m in right now. Which is exactly what these posts allow me to do, <strong>calm down. </strong></p>\n<p>Here are my three re-evaluated priorities for the remaining 4-5 weeks of the semester:</p>\n<h4>Letterbox &#8211; my CS3216 baby</h4>\n<p>This project is what makes this semester so much more worth it. Having a project that I care about to work on. Not going to reveal too much about it here, but here&#8217;s the awesome logo that my teammate designed:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://xbili.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/letterbox-logo.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"570\" data-permalink=\"https://xbili.wordpress.com/2015/10/11/oh-im-a-mess-right-now-inside-out/letterbox-logo/\" data-orig-file=\"https://xbili.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/letterbox-logo.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1000,1000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Letterbox-Logo\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://xbili.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/letterbox-logo.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://xbili.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/letterbox-logo.jpg?w=1000\" class=\"wp-image-570 aligncenter\" src=\"https://xbili.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/letterbox-logo.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"Letterbox-Logo\" width=\"256\" height=\"256\" srcset=\"https://xbili.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/letterbox-logo.jpg?w=256 256w, https://xbili.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/letterbox-logo.jpg?w=512 512w, https://xbili.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/letterbox-logo.jpg?w=150 150w, https://xbili.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/letterbox-logo.jpg?w=300 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Really excited to ship this by Monday night if possible!</p>\n<h4>Technical Interviews</h4>\n<p>There will be a bout of interviews heading my way soon and I <strong>need </strong>to be prepared for them. That means to revise my algorithms as much as possible, and get familiar explaining them to people. There&#8217;s a couple of ways I can do this. 1. Do as much Hackerrank problems as possible, or 2. Go through my CS2020 concepts once more. (I still have my cheatsheet with me)</p>\n<p>Or a combination of both if I have the time. I think the latter should be a better option since I need a serious refresher on my basic algorithms &amp; data structures.</p>\n<h4>Academics</h4>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been neglecting this aspect of school a lot this semester. Putting in only minimal efforts for my other modules. Perhaps it&#8217;s time to start revising for finals considering that I am lagging behind in the first place. Set up a timetable to see how much time I have left again and proceed on from there.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I once told myself that &#8220;having poor results for other modules due to CS3216 is bullshit.&#8221; I still think that is the case and I&#8217;m not willing to give my results up for this semester. It is possible to have the best for both and the only reason why it is not happening is because <strong>I have not been trying hard enough. </strong></p>\n<p>Ciao.</p>\n","date":"2015-10-11T07:13:11.000Z"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"oh-im-a-mess-right-now-inside-out"}}}
