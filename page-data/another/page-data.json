Well I&#8217;ve accomplished quite a lot for this weekend. Managed to cover pointers in C++! It&#8217;s a confusing concept, especially it&#8217;s applications, but I hope to master it by Tuesday. Coding is like math, I need more practice in order to fully understand a concept.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m already halfway through C++, but read online that not many people code in C++ nowadays. It&#8217;s a must-learn language, but not a useful language. I wonder why&#8230; <img width='16' height='16' class='wp-smiley emoji' draggable='false' alt=':\\' src='https://s1.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/uneasy.svg' style='height: 1em; max-height: 1em;' /> Maybe I&#8217;ll realize it soon as I continue to learn.Â </p>\n<p>Next language I have in mind would be Python. I don&#8217;t really know why I have to learn Python so badly, but I just want to learn Python. Is that even a good thing? If anybody could see this, please reply ðŸ˜¦</p>\n<p>Anyway, no matter what I learn, I just want to learn it well, and make sure that it&#8217;s useful for me in the future. That&#8217;s all for now. My dad just got a Facebook and I sure have to help him set up some stuff ðŸ™‚Â </p>\n<p>Ciao!</p>\n","date":"2013-06-09T12:35:25.000Z"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"another"}}}
