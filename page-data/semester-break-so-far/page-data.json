I&#8217;ve spent quite a bit of time making sure certain features work, and nothing beats the feeling of uploading the final product.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not quite finished yet, there are still certain issues here and there, especially for mobile. (Now I know why people curse and swear over responsive web design, it really isn&#8217;t easy) Also, code quality. I believe my CSS is really messy, and that&#8217;s something to work on as well. I&#8217;ve <a href=\"https://github.com/xbili/ecomore\" target=\"_blank\">put the project up on GitHub</a> to manage issues, since I find that a very productive way of getting work done.</p>\n<h2>EPUB version of SICP:</h2>\n<p>After CS1101S, I&#8217;ve signed up for CS1010R, a 1MC research module that allows us to work on certain aspect of CS1101S in order to make it a better module. Being quite an avid user of EPUB myself, I decided to take on the challenge of creating an EPUB version of our textbook, <a href=\"http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs1101s/sicp/\" target=\"_blank\">SICP</a>. The challenges that comes with this is:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Our version of the textbook isn&#8217;t complete, so we have to make sure that it is easy to update to the latest EPUB version every time something new gets released</li>\n<li>With regards to 1, it means that the whole process has to be automated</li>\n<li>XML/XSL is a new thing to me, learning something so complex on the fly can be really daunting (It is, I&#8217;m still confused with how XSL works)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Nothing worth doing ever comes easy. This has been my main priority for the semester break.</p>\n<h2>iHouse360 tweaks:</h2>\n<p>What I do with the <a href=\"http://singapore.ihouse360.com/\" target=\"_blank\">iHouse360 website</a> is not amazing, but really developing an eye for detail. I&#8217;m tasked with settling some of the styling issues of the website. Also, it forces me to work with WordPress which even though I&#8217;m using to post this blog right now, I&#8217;ve yet to understand what&#8217;s going on under-the-hood. It requires me to learn quite a bit of PHP, so&#8230; I&#8217;m not sure where this would lead me. I&#8217;ve heard scary stories about PHP, most of it tells me to stay away from it. <img width='16' height='16' class='wp-smiley emoji' draggable='false' alt=':\\' src='https://s1.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/uneasy.svg' style='height: 1em; max-height: 1em;' /></p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://xbili-showtrackr.herokuapp.com\" target=\"_blank\">Showtrackr</a>:</h2>\n<p>Ahhh, my not-so-little side project. Remember I mentioned that I put Ecomore&#8217;s website up on GitHub to handle issues? Exactly, I figured that a better way of working on your side project is to <strong>create new issues yourself, </strong>and then fix them one by one. It&#8217;s like a to-do list, but a technical one.</p>\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t only get work done, but also records them down in an organised way of how you progressed. Amazing tool, try it out yourself for any side projects of your own.</p>\n<p>You could check out my progress <a href=\"https://github.com/xbili/xbili-showtrackr\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>There&#8217;s my semester break so far, and I believe I have 3 more weeks to go. Certain things I should really get down to doing would be <a href=\"http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/\" target=\"_blank\">MIT 6.006</a>, which I&#8217;m still stuck at lecture 5. I&#8217;m supposed to finish the course by this semester. Oh well, perhaps a break from academics would be better.</p>\n<p>Time to binge-watch MIT-OCW.</p>\n","date":"2014-12-27T04:34:40.000Z"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"semester-break-so-far"}}}
