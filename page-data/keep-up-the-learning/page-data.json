The highest level of your skill.</p>\n<h1>Obviously, I&#8217;m not reaching, nor am I anywhere near that stage.</h1>\n<p>It simply means that I need toÂ <strong>switch up my methods.Â </strong>Plainly reading has bored me, well sort of. Coding for the sake of coding everyday is desensitising my thirst for learning new things. It&#8217;s another comfort zone, but aÂ <em>fake pro comfort zone.Â </em>Where I think I&#8217;m getting too good for myself, and instead fall into a vicious cycle of procrastination. We all know these excuses.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Oh I&#8217;ll do it tomorrow. It&#8217;s gonna go down tomorrow, I promise.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For a change, here&#8217;s what I have in mind for the upcoming month:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Start on a new project, making use of what you&#8217;ve learnt from your previous project.<br /></strong>I learnt quite a bit of Angular and new Javascript tools from my previous project, but I can&#8217;t seem to understand how it comes together. I ought to piece them together by myself to see clearly how each of them are connected. Take a look at my previous project <a href=\"http://immense-reaches-4201.herokuapp.com\">here</a>! It&#8217;s not perfect yet, and I plan to leave it that way. There are certain bugs which I cannot find (mostly due to typo), and solving them is too great an opportunity cost. I rather re-write an app that works, and learn something more out of it.</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Read more, but this time, more on coding.<br /></strong>I&#8217;ve read lots of other stuff, but not programming specific articles. I always thought those stuff were too advanced for me.Â <em>Oh design patterns, machine learning, etc.Â </em>Everyone has to start somewhere. Perhaps reading about technical topics would encourage me to understand on a deeper level what is going on.Â \n<p>That being said, I&#8217;m still going to continue reading fiction and self-help books and articles. (<em>Yes I&#8217;m looking at you A Song of Ice and Fire)Â </em>Tembusu college has a great reading room, whereÂ <em><strong>reading</strong></em><strong>Â </strong>is encouraged in it. No homework allowed! A great resolution would be to spend a minimum of 15 minutes in the reading room before bed everyday, just to read whatever. ðŸ™‚</li>\n<li><strong>Edit one Wikipedia article everyday.<br /></strong>What?!Â <em>What has this got to do with anything at all?!\n<p></em>I signed up for a Wikipedia account recently, and I found that there are lots ofÂ <em>mini-tasksÂ </em>on Wikipedia to be done. Such as citing sources, grammatical errors, etc. All these work on my reading, writing, and most of all, research abilities.Â </p>\n<p>What&#8217;s more, you get to learn something new everyday when you research Wikipedia topics! Isn&#8217;t that a win-win?</p>\n<p>I know, this sounds as ridiculous to me as it is to you. I&#8217;m not sure if this would work out fine, but <i>you never know if you never try!Â </i>ðŸ˜€</li>\n<li><strong>Keep coding.<br /></strong>I don&#8217;t think I have to elaborate on this any further&#8230;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That&#8217;s what I have in mind so far. It&#8217;s three weeks before school starts, and I have two more school camps to attend. Which leaves me with just one week to achieve these small little goals.Â </p>\n<p>Until I hit another plateau, I&#8217;ll stick with these little habits! Code on, live on! ðŸ˜›</p>\n","date":"2014-07-13T15:20:16.000Z"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"keep-up-the-learning"}}}
