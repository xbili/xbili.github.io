I may be stagnating after a month of really fast paced work. Now that things are starting to settle, I find myself learning at a slower rate. Maybe it&#8217;s time to force myself to learn more.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The perks of working in a startup consist of insanely fast paced work culture and (somewhat) freedom of doing what you want. Given a project, I had almost full&nbsp;control of how I want&nbsp;to achieve the end product. The pitfalls that comes with this would be the lack of a proper structure of how should an intern learn. Similar to how CS1101S throws us&nbsp;into the deep end, expecting us&nbsp;to somehow figure things out. It&#8217;s pretty much independent learning while making full use of the resources you have around you.</p>\n<p>Just a few things off my head that I want to achieve in the remaining two months:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Learn to give a short technical talks about side projects, cool new technologies etc.</li>\n<li>Have a firm grasp of CSS architecture, and refactor most of the CSS/LESS that I&#8217;ve written</li>\n<li>Get a clearer picture of the entire deployment process, I&#8217;ll need it for Tembusu&#8217;s orientation website in time to come</li>\n<li>Increase productivity by learning to use my tools well (Git, iTerm2, Sublime/Vim etc.)</li>\n<li><strong>Get off caffeine &amp; junk food&nbsp;dependencies</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The last one is pretty important. I shouldn&#8217;t be fuelled by caffeine and chips&nbsp;<em>all the time</em>.</p>\n<p>For a start, I&#8217;ve been trying to write in <a href=\"xbili.com\">xbili.com</a>&nbsp;more frequently about what I learnt during&nbsp;work. Yes, I&#8217;ve bought my own domain just to play around.</p>\n","date":"2015-06-15T17:09:58.000Z"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"if-theres-one-thing-you-could-change-about-your-internship"}}}
