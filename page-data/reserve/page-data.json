Well, it was a great experience overall, despite the fact that I was only a reserve in the end.</p>\n<p>Couple of reasons why I really enjoyed past month training for this event:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong></strong><strong>Keeps me exercising everyday!Â </strong>I think it&#8217;s done a great deal to my physical strength after these two weeks of training. I don&#8217;t want to stop this habit of a morning swim session, I feel good for the rest of the day after every swim session.</li>\n<li><strong>Corrected my strokes.Â </strong>I finally got used to swimming freestyle for long distances, and also a more efficient breaststroke. Butterfly and backstroke aren&#8217;t my thing, but still&#8230; Better than before. Which means improvement.Â <em>Improvement makes everything much more worth it.Â </em></li>\n<li><strong>Great company!Â </strong>The people whom I met at swimming were really friendly and great. Conversations about anything and everything. Mostly about swimming (duh) and some great tips on University education!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Other than these, I think swimming has made me realise something too.</p>\n<h3>Being very good at something isn&#8217;t easy.</h3>\n<p>Till now I still wonder why wasn&#8217;t I good enough to make it for the team, but it appears that other people were simply just <em>better</em> than me. It was for the best of the team to do without me. That&#8217;s still a contribution, <em>giving them a choice</em>. ðŸ™‚</p>\n<p>But from now on, I think it is important to push myself to be the best at whatever I do, be it swimming, coding, or anything that I love. As Mike reminded Walter White:</p>\n<blockquote><p>No more half measures.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>That Breaking Bad reference. ðŸ˜›</em></p>\n<p>That sums up what are my thoughts for the swimming event that I just (sorta) was a part of.</p>\n","date":"2013-11-27T10:42:22.000Z"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"reserve"}}}
