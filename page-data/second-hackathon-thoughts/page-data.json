Just yesterday, I participated inÂ Emirates Travel Hackathon, co-organized by Web In Travel (WIT). The experience this time was much more fulfilling than the previous. From the ideation to execution, there were key takeawaysÂ in every phase.</p>\n<p>We built <strong>Big Brother</strong>, which aims to <em>improve your travel experience by making use of beacon aided geo-locational marketing and gamification</em>. It seemed like a good idea to everyone and up till now I still believe it is. DespiteÂ not winning anything in the end, the knowledge and experience we gained from this 24-hour was remarkable.</p>\n<p>Here are a few of the takeaways from the Hackathon.</p>\n<h3>Start with the idea.</h3>\n<p>I think we spent two/three weeks in advance brainstorming for ideas and we didn&#8217;t really know what to do until three days before the actual hackathon. It was a great idea that we could all decide on, but we could&#8217;ve decided on it earlier. Having an early idea means more time for refining,Â rather than coming up with brand new ideas.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty glad that we had Regina on our team, despite her not being a developer, since she contributed most of the ideas and design. If there&#8217;s one thing I should learn from her, it would be the ability to present and speak in front of an audience with such confidence.</p>\n<h3>Decide the technology stack based on the team&#8217;s capabilities.</h3>\n<p>We went with Android development initially, but switched to iOS at 2am because the Android app just wasn&#8217;t working as well as we wish it would. Half of the time (which was a day) was spent on making the Android app work, and it could have been a smoother experience if we went ahead with iOS from the start. We really didn&#8217;t expect Android development to be such a hassle, but at least we got a working iOS demo up and running.</p>\n<h3>Many times I found myself useless.</h3>\n<p>ThisÂ happens all the time after I finished fixing a certain bug, or pushed a new feature out. I&#8217;ll be left wondering &#8220;what else can be done?&#8221; It&#8217;s pretty easy to run out of things to do, but at a hackathon, it&#8217;s a freeÂ <strong>learn-fest</strong>. I am consistently amused by the speed thatÂ I am able to learn at, and how much I can learn in 24-hours. The context of learning is also different since we apply the knowledge to practical situationsÂ on the spot. The <em>learn-by-doing</em> principle kicks in pretty fast.</p>\n<p>Similar to army experiences, I tried to make myself useful. I recall this phrase which came into my mind when I ORD:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Even if the most ordinary of situations, some chooseÂ be extraordinary.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Go beyond and find more things to do. If there&#8217;s one thing that I regret not doing is realising this earlier on. I could have gotten more done over 24 hours. I spent at least half of the time trying to figure out how else I could contribute.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>These are the three main takeaways that I had from the hackathon. Despite our team not winning anything, I still think it was an enriching and fulfilling event. Or as we put it, it was an undeserved loss. ðŸ˜€ There&#8217;s just so much out there to learn and environments like theseÂ are very well catered toÂ train the mind to learn, and learn fast.</p>\n<p>Looking forward to the next (BattleHack Singapore), and many more hackathons ahead!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>UPDATE: We actually won TripAdvisor&#8217;s API prize. Didn&#8217;t know that until the organizers sent us an email. Yay! ðŸ˜€</p>\n<p>Anyway, just another thought while on the bus today.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Ever tried, ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again, <strong>fail better</strong>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>That pretty much concludes what I feel about this hackathon. Here&#8217;s a picture of the team without Yiwen.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://xbili.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/photo-15-3-15-15-22-48.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"456\" data-permalink=\"https://xbili.wordpress.com/2015/03/15/second-hackathon-thoughts/photo-15-3-15-15-22-48/\" data-orig-file=\"https://xbili.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/photo-15-3-15-15-22-48.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"3264,2448\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.2&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;iPhone 6&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1426432968&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;4.15&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;400&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.066666666666667&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Photo 15-3-15 15 22 48\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://xbili.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/photo-15-3-15-15-22-48.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://xbili.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/photo-15-3-15-15-22-48.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-456\" src=\"https://xbili.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/photo-15-3-15-15-22-48.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"Photo 15-3-15 15 22 48\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https://xbili.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/photo-15-3-15-15-22-48.jpg?w=300 300w, https://xbili.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/photo-15-3-15-15-22-48.jpg?w=600 600w, https://xbili.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/photo-15-3-15-15-22-48.jpg?w=150 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Adios!</p>\n","date":"2015-03-15T14:20:41.000Z"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"second-hackathon-thoughts"}}}
