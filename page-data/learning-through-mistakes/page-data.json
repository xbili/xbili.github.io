It was a pretty inspiring and relatable talk especially after I completed an internship at a growing startup.</p>\n<p>One of the more relatable point that was mentioned is <strong>learning through mistakes</strong>. Several questions were brought up on rewriting the tech stack and choosing the right stack from the beginning. I think Wei Xiang did a great job addressing these concerns that us budding software engineers often have. While there are really ways to learn by RTFM (Read the F-ing Manual), some things can only come with experience. Going through the process of making a mistake and recovering is actually the best process of learning. This gives me more confidence that what I&#8217;m doing for my project technically is correct (even though it might be all the wrong decisions made, but at the end of it I&#8217;ll learn something).</p>\n<p>CS3216 is really fun, but I&#8217;ve been neglecting my other modules. Should probably start to take school a bit more seriously. I have no regrets taking this module so early on though. Skills acquired here will definitely be of great value!</p>\n<p>Fingers crossed that all will go well! ðŸ™‚</p>\n","date":"2015-08-24T14:42:11.000Z"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"learning-through-mistakes"}}}
