From now till then, I&#8217;ve got a couple of goals set. And I really hope to crush these goals. </p>\n<h2>First, brush up on my math. </h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ve selected a few math courses from MIT&#8217;s OpenCourseWare. It&#8217;s been 2 years since I&#8217;ve done any challenging math questions, and walking right into NUS with math abilities like that is instant suicide. I suppose I&#8217;m going to need a few visits to the library to get some textbooks, since I&#8217;ve thrown all of my JC notes away. (<em>I know, I threw them away the day A levels ended</em>) Other than brushing up, I need to expose myself to new concepts of math that CS needs. I read on Quora that it&#8217;s a totally different field, and it&#8217;s mind-blowing. That&#8217;s great, I love mind-blowing. Moving on&#8230;</p>\n<h2>Work on projects, and finish the projects. </h2>\n<p>What&#8217;s good if you learnt a programming language, and leave it as it is? Over my USA trip, I&#8217;ve designed a website by making use of HTML/CSS and JS skills acquired over my 6 months of learning. It isn&#8217;t very complete yet, but at least it got shipped. I still have to make a few adjustments. Check it out <a href=\"http://www.ecomorecorp.com\">here</a>! Recently I&#8217;ve been working on different algorithm implementation with C++ as well, and it&#8217;s not been going good. I didn&#8217;t want to finish CS50 to forget all of it the next day. Thus I&#8217;ve been revising some fundamental concepts which I should have mastered, but didn&#8217;t. Projects are a great way of making sure of such things. Even if the project isn&#8217;t an actual project, i.e. just tinkering with code, it offers as a platform to learn. And learn is exactly what I need to do right now.</p>\n<h2>Write. </h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been shortlisted for NUS&#8217;s University Scholar&#8217;s Programme (USP) interview, and I ought to prepare for it. Preparing for the interview is one thing, but if I get admitted, with my writing skills as such, I wouldn&#8217;t survive the massive amount of essays that will head my way. I love to write, but I&#8217;m not good at it. There&#8217;s always room for improvement, and to do so, MIT OpenCourseWare is my best friend right now. There is a course on Essay Writing, and it provides lots of readings coupled with assignments. I would need a mentor for my work though, got to keep looking. <strong>I have to get it that I&#8217;m not good at writing, despite my love for writing</strong>. I definitely need to work on it. This doesn&#8217;t mean if I don&#8217;t get into USP, I would give up on this. I think writing is going to be important even after university. There&#8217;s that. </p>\n<h2>Set out my priorities for university.</h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ve seen some of my friends entering university and suffered through it, while some were having fun and enjoying themselves. I think this would be the code that I&#8217;ll live by in university:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Be yourself, be free, have fun and don&#8217;t forget to DOMINATE.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I&#8217;ve written that down on a card, and it should be up on my wall/pin-board when school starts. Nobody would care about you if you&#8217;re just a <em>cool dude </em>with <em>great attitude and personality. </em>I have to dominate in my field, which is also my studies. Give in my best and I&#8217;m sure this wouldn&#8217;t be that difficult. Let&#8217;s see what happens when the ball starts rolling. </p>\n<h2>Exercise, exercise, exercise. </h2>\n<p>Recently I&#8217;ve been working out every morning, since I&#8217;m waking up at 6am due to jet-lag. This habit has to continue though, because it gives me that pick-me-up everyday. Also, I&#8217;ve lost plenty of weight due to a bad traveller&#8217;s diarrhoea that I suffered in the States. Now that I&#8217;m back, it&#8217;s time for some recovery workout! There&#8217;s an IPPT waiting for me to take too, it&#8217;s $200 bucks if I get a silver and I&#8217;m not going to let that money slip away, now that I&#8217;m unemployed. </p>\n<p>That&#8217;s all my plans so far, and I do hope it would be sufficient enough to prepare me for university life. Once again, <em>let&#8217;s just see what happens when the ball starts rolling. </em></p>\n<p>Till next time! </p>\n","date":"2014-04-23T03:51:23.000Z"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"pre-university-preperation"}}}
