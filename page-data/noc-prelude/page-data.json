It still feels pretty surreal that I am here in Silicon Valley, where I dreamed of going ever since I fell in love with programming.</p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s important to set the goals and aspirations straight for NOC. It&#8217;s a very unique and special program and there are different ways of approaching it. So here&#8217;s just oneÂ humble goal I wish to achieve.</p>\n<h3>Level up, more.</h3>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been keeping this goal for every semester in NUS and it&#8217;s something that I really value.Â <em>Keep levelling up.Â </em>First semester I had CS1101S, which challenged the way I think about programming. Then I went on to fulfil my thirst for software engineering by contributing to NUSMods during my first winter break.</p>\n<p>In the following semester, I took on a project of my own, which was compiling an EPUB version of SICP in JavaScript. Although it wasn&#8217;t perfect, it still taught me many valuable lessons about web development. Also coupled with an accelerated algorithms course (CS2020) which once again proved to be challenging.</p>\n<p>Then in my freshman year&#8217;s summer, I felt the need to take on something on a bigger scale, of more importance and challenge. I joined ShopBack and was part of the UI redesign and reimplementation. It was a really fruitful 3 months spent despite the tough times.Â In the most recent semester, I took up the challenge of CS3216 and I learned and achieved more than I could ever imagine, at the cost of my other grades.</p>\n<p>The thirst to level up pushed me through all these tough times. None of the above made my life easy, but I believe it was through the struggles and pains that I am able to improve and better myself. I am glad of where I am today, and I am excited for where I will go in the future.</p>\n<p>Looking forward to NOC, it shall be <strong>a whole year</strong> of level-ing up. Taking on a role of <strong>Platform Engineer </strong>at <strong>EasilyDo</strong>, something I am totally not familiar with considering that I came from mostly a frontend background.</p>\n<p>Work should not be the onlyÂ source of learning, spending a year in Silicon Valley, the Mecca of software engineering and innovation, should also open my eyes to more engineering and startup culture.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Be like a sponge, absorb.Â Learn and imitate what is good, improve what is bad.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Keep quenching this thirst to improve, keep setting higher expectations for myself. This is what the next year&#8217;s gonna be about. ðŸ™‚</p>\n<h3></h3>\n","date":"2015-12-29T20:41:47.000Z"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"noc-prelude"}}}
