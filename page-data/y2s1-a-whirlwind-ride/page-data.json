The entire semester has been a whirlwind ride, here are some reflections.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Work is manageable, time isn&#8217;t.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This has to be the greatest lesson learnt. Modules are actually pretty straightforward and easy to understand if I had put in consistent effort weekly for the entire semester.</p>\n<h3>Focus on what is important</h3>\n<p>I would say that most of my time were not spent being productive on the things that matters. In other words, I spend too much time thinking rather than doing. It&#8217;s a habit that I should try get rid of as soon as possible. CS3216 did take up most of my time this semester but I have to admit that the remaining time were not well spent. This was pretty evident when I screwed up midterms big time because I did not do my revision according to plan.</p>\n<h3>Being more proactive</h3>\n<p>Resources are out there to be utilised. I&#8217;ve gotten a bit more lazy this semester in terms of actively seeking out help from tutors and professors on help. I would gladly use CS3216 as a convenient excuse for me to have &#8216;no time&#8217;. But I am quite certain this isn&#8217;t the case. It all goes back to the part on time management.</p>\n<h3>Exercise, don&#8217;t neglect it</h3>\n<p>The exercise counter for this semester is close to zero. Apart from the weekly captain&#8217;s ball sessions, I&#8217;ve not been doing any exercise of my own. (Not to mention there&#8217;s IPPT coming up tomorrow)</p>\n<h3>Let go of thoughts</h3>\n<p>Sometimes thoughts are toxic, and they affect the way I function on a daily basis. Many times this semester there was a need to empty and gather back my thoughts. It helps me reconsider what matters and what doesn&#8217;t. These thoughts stems from every aspect of my daily life and it&#8217;s important to let go and ignore them sometimes.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Overall it wasn&#8217;t a pleasant semester, but I&#8217;m excited for the next stage of my life in Silicon Valley for a year.</p>\n<p>Looking forward! ðŸ™‚</p>\n","date":"2015-12-22T08:26:19.000Z"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"y2s1-a-whirlwind-ride"}}}
