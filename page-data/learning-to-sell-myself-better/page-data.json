When I say &#8216;sell myself&#8217;, it does not refer to prostitution. Rather, it refers to the ability to show others what kind of person you are.Â </p>\n<div>After reflecting how the USP interview went with my parents, they all agreed that I&#8217;ve shown too little. In other words, I&#8217;ve failed to &#8216;sell myself&#8217;. I did not mention at all about my travels to Peru, neither did I mention about the two overseas community projects which I&#8217;ve been to when I was younger.Â </div>\n<div>Â </div>\n<div><b>Unknowingly, I&#8217;ve considered these activities as something that wouldn&#8217;t impress.</b></div>\n<div>Â </div>\n<div>I did not even list it down as &#8216;Community Involvement&#8217; during the application progress. It was a mistake that I have to live with now, albeit a small one.Â </div>\n<div>Â </div>\n<div>Having spent the first 4 years of my life with my grandparents, I shared my thoughts with them right after the interview. They agreed that I was being too humble, or as a Chinese saying goes, ç•™æœ‰ä½™åœ°. My relatives and parents warned me about my weakness, which is extreme humility and cautiousness. I don&#8217;t have that confidence that I should have, and it&#8217;s portraying the wrong side of me to others. Now that even my grandparents see my weak side, it&#8217;s inevitable.Â <strong>I have to do something.</strong></div>\n<div>Â </div>\n<div>I think one of the baby steps that I could take would be to communicate more efficiently with my friends and peers. I&#8217;ll start with people whom I&#8217;m most comfortable with, then slowly progress on to more distant friends. When it comes to conversations with strangers, I&#8217;d haveÂ to think of the fastest way that I can sell myself to them as an interesting person. It sounds like going to a matchmaking party, but I assure you this is for a much greater cause than to get myself laid.Â </div>\n<div>Â </div>\n<div>Lastly, I have to keep writing. The more I write, the more I think. The more I think, the more contentÂ I have in mind that I could just pull out and start a conversation with.Â </div>\n<div>Â </div>\n<div>I just got back from China and currently I&#8217;m unemployed. I spent the whole of yesterday on the computer, idling. Here&#8217;s a decision that I made earlier during lunch.Â <strong>Even if I&#8217;m not going to work, I better make sure I&#8217;m doing something to better myself.Â </strong>Learning to sell myself would be one of the many priorities I have during this &#8216;vacation&#8217; between now and the start of school semester.</div>\n<div>Â </div>\n<div>Till then. ðŸ™‚Â </div>\n","date":"2014-05-22T05:48:59.000Z"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"learning-to-sell-myself-better"}}}
