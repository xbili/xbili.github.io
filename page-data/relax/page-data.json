After what happened with my USP application, I learnt a really valuable lesson.</p>\n<p><strong>Relax. </strong></p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been unable to sleep days before my USP interview. On the day of interview, I arrived too early at Cinnamon and was in a total mess. I look fine on the outside, but on the inside, I&#8217;m actually going through a mental hurricane. Thoughts about what were they going to ask, how am I going to respond. I summarised that for an interview, I have to prepare <strong>to a certain extent</strong>. Excessive preparation leads to a blank mind when an unexpected question is being asked.</p>\n<p>Next, I have to address my anxiety issues, which leads to bad linguistic abilities. Nerves can be wrecking, and I suppose it is time to start controlling them. Relax the mind, maintain the clarity of thought, and articulate slowly to give yourself time to think. I recognised the importance of linguistics a little too late, but as cliché as it sounds, <i>it&#8217;s never too late for anything. </i></p>\n<p>I am determined that if I&#8217;m given another chance for an interview with either Tembusu or CAPT, I will not screw it up. I&#8217;ll go into that interview and talk, <strong>like Bili can talk. </strong></p>\n","date":"2014-06-01T13:14:27.000Z"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"relax"}}}
