Considering that the PSI (Pollutant Standards Index) is currently at a record high 290.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m coughing really badly. My guess that it was mostly due to my previous episode with flu and cold, which has now evolved into sort of a sore throat and cough. The weather&#8217;s not making it any better. (Duh)</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s really slowed down a lot of what I want to do, including coding which I really get to enjoy. I&#8217;m already at references which is kinda like pointers, a hard concept to understand, albeit a useful one.</p>\n<p>And because I&#8217;m coughing every few seconds, I couldn&#8217;t really think of a code to write out a multiplication table in code and run it well. It should have been simple. An array, couple of variables and a few nested loops. Input/output and tada there goes the end product. But I just couldn&#8217;t sort it out and when I look at online solutions it just doesn&#8217;t click with my brain. It sounds like a really stupid excuse but it&#8217;s true. ðŸ˜¥ Hopefully I recover soon. Even my private doctor from theÂ neighbourhoodÂ clinic seems to be very busy. Came back home for nights off and could not even get a number.</p>\n<p>Oh dear, times like these are hard, but it sure will make us feel more appreciative of our clean air in Singapore after this whole &#8220;Haze-saga&#8221; is over. Let&#8217;s not take things for granted. ðŸ™‚</p>\n<p>Also on the other hand, I do hope that I&#8217;ll recover soon enough so that I will be able to continue to code and get better everyday. It really matters a lot to me because this time when I start,Â <strong>there&#8217;s no turning back.</strong></p>\n<p>Tata.</p>\n","date":"2013-06-19T13:27:58.000Z"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"weather"}}}
