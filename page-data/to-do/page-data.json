To me, programming is all about fundamentals. If there&#8217;s a solid foundation, you could always build on it.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve decided to create a simple, yet elegant To-Do list. It&#8217;s still work in progress, but I&#8217;m sure that it&#8217;ll be out soon enough.</p>\n<p>My limitations in data management is really giving me troubles. I&#8217;ve got a main page, an input box, and a button. Well, it sounds like it&#8217;s done! But no, I couldn&#8217;t properly assign the value inside the input box into an array. Well strictly speaking I managed to do that, but afterwards I couldn&#8217;t print the array out.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s really troublesome to keep referring to the API documentation of jQuery, but I guess that&#8217;s how everyone learn! And I&#8217;m learning.</p>\n<p>Honestly I didn&#8217;t expect the learning curve to be this steep. But as always, most people stop when things start to get difficult. I shall not stop.</p>\n<p>Wait for that awesome To-Do list! It&#8217;s my first project that has a UI. ðŸ™‚</p>\n","date":"2013-07-11T14:40:30.000Z"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"to-do"}}}
