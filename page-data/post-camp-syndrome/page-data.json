(Despite the fact that I got down with fever and sore throat the second day I came home)</p>\n<p>Back to reality though, I realise that I&#8217;m pit against some of the best in NUS, and it&#8217;s not going to be easy to rise to the top. That being said, I should really get my shit together fast before I start to slip. There are many freshmenÂ with programming experience far more advanced and in-depth than mine. It&#8217;s no surprise, considering that I&#8217;m self-taught and all the code I&#8217;ve written are for my silly little projects. It&#8217;s time to step my game up, and code more, and code efficiently. ðŸ™‚</p>\n<p>The camp also brought back some of my social skills which I&#8217;ve lost. Apparently, spending two years in the army communicatingÂ in simple (really simple) talks have taken a toll on my social abilities. Alas, this camp is called FreshmenÂ <strong>SocialÂ </strong>Camp. It did serve it&#8217;s purpose well ðŸ˜›</p>\n<p>Tembusu finally sent me an email asking me to schedule an interview. I can&#8217;t be more thankful for this opportunity given. Having written so much about interviews previously, I hope this time things will go differently.Â </p>\n","date":"2014-06-20T09:09:21.000Z"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"post-camp-syndrome"}}}
