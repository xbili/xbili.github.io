A few things!</p>\n<p><strong>First, I&#8217;m focusing a lot on C++ depth.<br /></strong>I brought my Primer C++ textbook into camp, so that I could focus on a topic a day, be it the basic arrays/variables, or the advanced classes and polymorphism. Learning something new a day would really help me in the long run. This is good, since I almost always have a bit of time at night for myself to improve.</p>\n<p><strong>Next up, digging into JavaScript.</strong><br />I had completed Codecademy&#8217;s JavaScript course quite a while back, but haven&#8217;t really put it to good use yet. I understand the basic syntax, classes and way of using it. But to understand a framework would take it to a whole new level.Â </p>\n<p>I&#8217;m currently struggling with node.js and express.js, but struggling is good. It means that after the struggle, progress is made. What I realise is that after a few tutorials watched and forgotten, you eventually remember all the important details.Â </p>\n<p><strong>How?Â </strong></p>\n<p>The tutorials are all similar in some way or another. The similar portions are usually the important parts of whatever you&#8217;re learning. Thus, I&#8217;m in a way absorbing information from multiple &#8220;teachers&#8221;, trying to catch the common gist of it. (It works, really, especially when you&#8217;re venturing into a totally unknown field)</p>\n<p><strong>Last but not least, relax&#8230;Â </strong><br />Your entire life shouldn&#8217;t be about coding. Coding is your life, but your life isn&#8217;t coding. I started watching Breaking Bad and Suits, two of the better television dramas out there. I&#8217;ve considered getting back to gaming again, but seeing how sucked into it I was back then, maybe not. Leave that for when the PS4 comes out. I&#8217;d really like to get one to bond with family/friends. Those type of gaming is actually beneficial! ðŸ™‚</p>\n<p>Other than that, I&#8217;m certainly more excited for my ORD which is coming up in approximately 5 months time. But I like to think of it another way&#8230;</p>\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s just another month to it.Â </strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong>Well, I got my way of interpreting it. That&#8217;s classified. ðŸ˜›</p>\n","date":"2013-10-02T13:15:14.000Z"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"due-for-an-update"}}}
