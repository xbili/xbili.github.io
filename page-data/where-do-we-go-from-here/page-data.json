I do believe that after all the reflections and lessons learnt, this is the fruit of my labour. But what&#8217;s more important is to view this not as a destination, but just the start of my journey. </p>\n<p><strong>So where do we go from here?</strong></p>\n<p>A good friend of mine recommended a well-written <a href=\"http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/07/06/opinion/sunday/the-secret-of-effective-motivation.html\">article</a> recently. It talks about internal motives and instrumental motives. The main point is that people with instrumental and internal motives, such as going to University to get a decent pay (<em>instrumental</em>), and to <strong>learn </strong>(<em>internal</em>), usually end up unsuccessful in achieving their motives. Whereas those with a lack of instrumental motives end up being successful in what they want to achieve. </p>\n<p>This sort of reminds me of <strong>So Good They Can&#8217;t Ignore You </strong>by <em>Cal Newport. </em>He mentioned that if you focus more on being a craftsmen of your own skill, passion and joy would come as a side product of the hard work. The true purpose of <em>learning </em>is so that you will emerge as a better person than you were yesterday. Be it in my craft, or the maturity of thought. All of the glamor comes as a side product of <em>learning. </em></p>\n<p><strong>What I&#8217;m trying to convince myself is that I&#8217;m in university to learn. To better myself, to educate myself. </strong></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s only the beginning, and I have secured yet another opportunity for me to better myself. I&#8217;m excited about what the road ahead has in store, and I&#8217;ll be sure to cherish every moment of it. </p>\n","date":"2014-07-08T03:39:36.000Z"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"where-do-we-go-from-here"}}}
