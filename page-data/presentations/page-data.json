It was pretty fortunate that I was given the opportunity to present in a lecture to CP3101B students about my experiences contributing to NUSMods. There&#8217;re a few lessons learnt from the short 5 minutes.\n</p>\n<h3>Speak slowly.</h3>\n<p>\nI spoke too fast and honestly I doubt if people even caught what I said. Nerves probably contributed to this and also maybe due to the minimal sleep I had the night before. Also, speaking too fast caused me to not speak into the microphone. Which is another problem in itself. What&#8217;s a presentation if people cannot even hear you?</p>\n<p>Something to keep in mind for next time.\n</p>\n<h3>Prepare slides with a theme.</h3>\n<p>\nMy <a href=\"http://xbili.github.io/nm-gettingstarted\">slides</a> didn&#8217;t really have a theme, and it was mainly me rambling on and on about whatever comes into my mind. By theme I mean content, not aesthetics. It is similar to writing a research paper without a thesis.&nbsp;<strong>What am I trying to get across to the audience?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h3>Look at the audience, not your slides.</h3>\n<p>\nI have a tendency to look at the slides in order to remember what I want to say. I guess sometimes it&#8217;s not about one presenting to another. Similar to a conversation between two,&nbsp;eye contact shows the amount of attention you give to them. So if I don&#8217;t give attention to my audience, why would any be given to me?</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s pretty logical.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Some people can present without planning, comfortable with giving impromptu speeches on stage. I&#8217;m really impressed by them, but that probably took years of hard work. Reducing the presentation problem to a set of algorithms probably isn&#8217;t the best idea, since a presentation is live and dynamic, it changes over time, any time. These skills come with experiences that can only be gained by participating more.</p>\n<p>Until the next opportunity shows up, I should focus more on bettering myself in other aspects of life. ðŸ™‚</p>\n","date":"2015-04-02T14:27:02.000Z"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"presentations"}}}
