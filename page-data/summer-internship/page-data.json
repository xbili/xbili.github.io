It&#8217;ll be a 3 month internship at <strong>ShopBack</strong>, focusing mainly on frontend development.</p>\n<p>3 months will fly by in the blink of an eye and here&#8217;s what I wish to gain from the internship:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>Level Up as a Developer</h4>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This should be my main goal. I should end the internship feeling more comfortable as a developer, having explored new fields at a greater depth. I&#8217;ve never dived into any technology in-depth before and this will be a very good opportunity to understand frontend development process.</p>\n<p><em>The most exciting part will be (as always) to learn as fast as possible. </em></p>\n<p>I always wonder why are software engineers interns are called interns instead of apprentices. We are craftsmen seeking to master our craft. That aside, I want to see for myself how does the software industry look like right now and how we can improve it. Even if I cannot make a difference, I would want to know what I can do to stay away from the pitfalls and get the most out of the good parts.</p>\n<p>Tech startups have been very hyped up recently and it is something I would want to experience before I settle for any career, startup or corporate, in the future. Summer is probably the best time to try new things and I am going to seize this opportunity.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s to an exciting summer!</p>\n","date":"2015-05-16T15:55:04.000Z"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"summer-internship"}}}
