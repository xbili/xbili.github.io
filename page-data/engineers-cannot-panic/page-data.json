After writing code for so long, it should be ingrained into me thatÂ <strong>software breaks all the time.Â </strong></p>\n<p>As a new developer, I panic very easily. I will not think properly and logically, and as a result breaking more things than I should have fixed. One day while doing pair programming with my mentor, I was panicking as usual and he said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Engineers cannot panic.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>This phrase stuck with me for quite a bit. I didn&#8217;t really feel the reason why this should be the case at first, but on the way home today, I thought of the engineers who worked on fixing the SMRT train failures the day before.</p>\n<p>Their job was way more tedious and the number of users affected by their fix rakes up to hundreds of thousands. The amount of stress that the engineers had must&#8217;ve been huge. But imagine what would happen if they panicked. Engineers are the ones who knows the system best. Keeping a clear mind and focusing on solving the problem at hand is what saves the day, not concerns about the consequences of screwing things up.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a little challenge to myself, the next time something breaks, take a deep breath and solve it in a calm and peaceful state of mind. Not forgetting to time myself to do it within a time limit. ðŸ™‚</p>\n","date":"2015-07-08T16:59:24.000Z"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"engineers-cannot-panic"}}}
