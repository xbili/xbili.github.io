Yay!</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s begin with the <strong>three</strong>Â languages I&#8217;ve played around with recently:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>C++.Â </strong>Yes, the language which I started with. I never really got to build things with this, but it&#8217;s a sooner or later thing. I&#8217;m still revising this language in order to grasp fully the concept of classes, pointers and references. They&#8217;re stillÂ <strong>really really confusing.Â </strong>I hope to master then soon enough with practice. ðŸ™‚</li>\n<li><strong></strong><strong>HTML5 and CSS.Â </strong>Yes, this may not seem to be a language per se, but I think it&#8217;s really useful to what I&#8217;m about to do in a few months time. Got a project from my aunt and I&#8217;m really looking forward to my first &#8220;project&#8221; ever. HTML and CSS are relativelyÂ <strong>easyÂ </strong>to understand. Despite that, I do believe there are still lots of things which I don&#8217;t understand quite yet. But I&#8217;ll get to them soon enough as the &#8220;project&#8221; progresses.Â <strong>Very excited for this.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>JavaScript.Â </strong>I finished this hoping to understand more of programming. Well it did help me a huge lot in understanding things which I struggled with in C++. It has similar syntax, (in fact it&#8217;s easier) and also different functionalities which is really useful. Also this would work in conjunction with HTML5 and CSS in my upcoming project.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Not forgetting to mention, I learnt both HTML and JavaScript from Codecademy. It&#8217;s really an amazing platform for beginners like me to venture into coding. It&#8217;s interactive, interesting and in the middle of every lesson, a small project which you&#8217;re guided to build something awesome. (Yes I&#8217;ve built lots of nonsensical apps using code just for laughs)</p>\n<p>Other than that, my recent episode withÂ sinusitis has really affected my physical abilities. Haven&#8217;t been exercising in quite a while and also not been playing much basketball. I hope that as I get better I&#8217;ll slowly kick back into action. Exercising is really important because they help meÂ <strong>focus more when coding. </strong>Somehow exercising just takes so much rubbish out of my head. ðŸ™‚</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m grateful for all the resources I have at my disposal right now in order to set me off on the right track in coding. I really hope that I&#8217;ll make more great progress in the months to come. There&#8217;s a long off from Friday to Tuesday, and I hope to make use of it to learn more of any of the three languages that I&#8217;ve learnt. Or better, create something cool with it!</p>\n<p>Something I realise about coding is that you can never fully understand a language and it&#8217;s functionality. All you could do is know a limited amount of small little tricks that you could use in order to write better code. But it&#8217;s virtually impossible to know all of these tricks. Just choose a few that&#8217;s really really useful, and then master them! I think that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m planning to do in the upcoming few months. I wanted to start on Python as well, but I think that should wait.</p>\n<p><strong>Stuffing too much food down my throat will suffocate me.</strong></p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s hope that more great things would happen soon! ðŸ™‚</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:15px;font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;\">Keep coding, it&#8217;s </span><strong style=\"font-size:15px;font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;\">awesome.Â </strong><span style=\"font-size:15px;font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;\">Â </span></p>\n","date":"2013-07-01T12:39:15.000Z"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"three"}}}
