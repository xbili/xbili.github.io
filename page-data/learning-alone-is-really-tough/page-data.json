There&#8217;s still about 3 more problem sets and I&#8217;m determined to finish them all!Â </p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve read on Quora <a href=\"http://qr.ae/GSNkJ\">here</a> that learning alone is painful. Yes it is. It&#8217;s been a tough journey so far, trying to figure out everything I know by myself. I&#8217;m quite proud of it, but at the same time, I have to remain humble because I know those with mentors would have probably covered at least 5 times more content than me. I really hope for a mentor who would guide me in the right direction. Hell, I would be happy enough to have a friend who&#8217;s into coding as well.Â </p>\n<p>Maybe I&#8217;m just not lucky enough to have such people in my life.Â </p>\n<p>Honestly I don&#8217;t know how long more can I sustain learning by myself, but so far I&#8217;ve been doing fine for the past 6 months. It&#8217;s been half a year since I&#8217;ve started coding!Â </p>\n<p>Other than coding, I&#8217;ve been working out quite a lot too. Basketball and swimming. Trying to maintain an active lifestyle. Christmas is coming, and I do hope there&#8217;ll be great plans this year! (Considering that I missed last Christmas due to standby duty in camp)</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s it, and I&#8217;ll probably do a 2013 wrap-up and a 2014 resolution post soon!Â </p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been a great six months of coding, and I&#8217;m looking forward to many many more! ðŸ™‚</p>\n","date":"2013-12-21T16:31:29.000Z"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"learning-alone-is-really-tough"}}}
