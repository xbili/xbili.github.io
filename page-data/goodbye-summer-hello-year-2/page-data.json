School is starting in a mere 2 weeks&#8217; time and here&#8217;s what I hope to achieve for my Sophomore year&#8217;s first semester!</p>\n<h1>CS3216: Software Engineering on Evolving Platforms</h1>\n<p>This shall be the love of my life for the next semester. I&#8217;ll be trying to put skills I&#8217;ve acquired at ShopBack into this module. Well I don&#8217;t see this module as a class per se. I see it more as an opportunity for me to do something extraordinary. The code that I&#8217;m going to write in this module should at least make a difference to somebody&#8217;s life out there. In fact that&#8217;s one of the main reason why I code extensively. The thought that my product could affect hundreds and thousands of users excites me. However I&#8217;ve heard scary stories how this module kills a lot of time, and sleepless night to rush for product launches etc. Well,Â <em>been there, done that. (Somewhat)</em></p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll write more about this in my class blog (which is required by the curriculum) <a href=\"http://xbili3216.wordpress.com\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<h1>CS Fundamentals</h1>\n<p>Not to say that my other modules are not important. I&#8217;m doing <strong>CS2102: Database Systems</strong>, <strong>CS2105: Introduction to Computer Networking</strong> and <strong>ST2334: Statistics and Probability</strong>. There&#8217;s one more Tembusu module which I&#8217;m not sure which to take yet. The two CS modules should provide me with adequate foundation knowledge that will allow me to level up into taking up more roles as a software engineer. While the last one is simply for the sake of strengthening my mathematical abilities.</p>\n<h1>Tembusu Orientation Site</h1>\n<p>This has been a side project for the summer (I&#8217;m pretty sure it qualifies as an orbital project but I didn&#8217;t sign up so). So Tembusu Orientation needed a website and I volunteered. It&#8217;s up and running well so far, I hope. It was my first time trying to deploy something on Amazon S3 and it&#8217;s pretty exciting.</p>\n<p>The idea of this project is to make this Open Source. It&#8217;s currently private on GitHub but I&#8217;ll open it soon. Every year the orientation committee has to go through the trouble of setting up an orientation website for the freshies and I think there should be a better solution to this.</p>\n<p>Well during the non-orientation time I hope the website can be used to scratch some of the itches of the new Tembusu computing freshies. Which reminds me, I should probably encourage most of them to get involved in coding for fun rather than coding for school ðŸ˜›</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I&#8217;ve been growing so much as a person over summer, and I can&#8217;t be more grateful for the opportunities and time I had. Both in ShopBack and my personal life.</p>\n<p>Still, keeping my University code to live by:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Be yourself, be free, have fun and don&#8217;t forget to dominate.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Here&#8217;s to more adventures in time to come!</p>\n<p>Stay strong. ðŸ™‚</p>\n","date":"2015-07-27T16:51:41.000Z"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"goodbye-summer-hello-year-2"}}}
