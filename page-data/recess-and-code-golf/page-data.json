Also known as the week of pure studying for mid terms, at least for us CS students.</p>\n<p>To start the recess week off proper, I attended a Code Golf session by NUSHackers. It sort of show me how detached I am from recreational programming. Lately CS1101S is getting more intense, and I&#8217;m often coding out solutions in JediScript, a neat little subscript of JavaScript. In fact, I&#8217;m more used to the JediScript library now compared to the usual JS things I&#8217;ve learnt before.</p>\n<p>Code Golf has taught me something valuable though:</p>\n<h2>The people who understand their tools well are usually those who solves problems.</h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ve done JS programming for quite a while now, but I still couldn&#8217;t return the index of the n-th occurrence of string s in string t. But what I&#8217;ve really learnt were neat and elegant concepts such as recursion, order of growth and data structures. There&#8217;s still some missing dots that I&#8217;ve yet to connect. One of the ways I could do that would be by coding my own projects with concepts learnt from this module so far.</p>\n<p><em>As Ryan mentioned I should probably fix my TicTacToe.</em></p>\n<p>As always when I try something new (Code Golf), I had a feeling thatÂ <em>I suck. </em>Interestingly I always tell myself it&#8217;s okay to suck. So long as I&#8217;m getting better and I&#8217;m trying.</p>\n<p>So yes, that was my &#8216;virgin&#8217; Code Golf experience, and what I&#8217;ve taken away from a short 2 hour session of coding little snippets. :3</p>\n","date":"2014-09-19T14:31:28.000Z"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"recess-and-code-golf"}}}
