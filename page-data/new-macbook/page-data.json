Had to return to camp to settle some &#8220;stuff&#8221; which I shouldn&#8217;t be blogging about. So I won&#8217;t!</p>\n<p>Okay so here&#8217;s what happened after I returned to camp. Went to Gain City with my dad who picked me up to take a look at the MacBook Pro with Retina display. Well apparently they bought an overpriced television, and could get a good $400 off if I bought a MBP there. So yeah, I needed one, they wanted that $400 off for a $1988 MBP, I&#8217;m happy, they&#8217;re happy, company&#8217;s happy, everyone&#8217;s happy! What&#8217;s the problem?</p>\n<p>So here am I blogging with my new MacBook Pro. My first actually. Didn&#8217;t thought of getting one until some of the websites online recommended getting an Apple product for coding because of it&#8217;s capabilities to run Bootcamp to dual boot into windows, and also to code for iOS with the OSX environment. That&#8217;s cool stuff, though it&#8217;ll take me quite a while before I actually get to coding with Objective-C. Right now I&#8217;ll just fiddle around with this new baby and see what can I do with it! ðŸ™‚</p>\n<p>Anyway a question, should I put on protectors for my MacBook Pro? Like palm protectors and trackpad protectors. Read that Apple don&#8217;t endorse it because they might cause scratches to the screen. Which I do agree! All the dust and sweat collected on the protector will eventually touch the screen&#8230; And there goes a perfectly fine Retina display.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m enjoying this Retina display and it shall be enjoyed by me for at least 5 years (considering that technology improvements don&#8217;t accelerate to the speed of light soon)</p>\n<p>Back to coding. Keep hacking guys, ciao.</p>\n","date":"2013-06-15T10:48:47.000Z"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"new-macbook"}}}
