This time I didn&#8217;t spend it studying my ass off in school. I actually did project after project and went home for a break. Having only two papers next week, I feel strangely confident. That&#8217;s a bad thing.</p>\n<p>I have a tendency to stay in school most weekends for fear of disrupting my workflow. But this semester has been different, I have not been focusing on what is important.</p>\n<p><strong>This half-time was spent productively at home.</strong></p>\n<p>I got actually got things done at home.

Your critics are the ones still telling you they love you and they care.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I&#8217;ve got people in my life who still genuinely believe in me and I am ever grateful¬†for their existence.
