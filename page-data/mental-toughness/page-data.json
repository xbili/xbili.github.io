Among all the craziness since the beginning of COVID-19, it has been eventful so far. It&#8217;s been almost 2 year since I&#8217;ve graduated, and worked as a Software Engineer. So I suppose it&#8217;s a good time to reflect on what I&#8217;ve learnt, and accomplished so far. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Completed the first semester of my Masters program </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This was <strong>way</strong> harder than I expected. Not the content itself, but the constant nagging at the back of my head after a tiring day at work to watch lectures online, revise textbook materials, and understand heaps of research paper. Not to mention the projects were much more intense than what I experienced back in undergrad days. The three projects assigned were to reproduce experiment results from published research papers. It sounded easy at first, right? I mean since it was published, it had to be well documented, and free from ambiguity. <strong>Wrong. </strong>I should have known better from my thesis writing days that reproducing results from a research paper is a painful process, filled with &#8220;what did the author mean by&#8230;&#8221;, and &#8220;what did the author do here?&#8221;. This underestimation, mixed with procrastination ultimately resulted in rushed projects. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, I still managed to pull a B for this first course in this program. Not the best, but not too bad too. Just kidding, it is pretty bad. But I suppose it&#8217;s good that I learned these painful lessons earlier in the program, so I can better fine tune my schedule for the next few semesters. Oh, and <strong>there is no way that I will take more than one class per semester</strong>. It just gets too crazy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Adapting to a pandemic</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>COVID-19 came knocking on 2020&#8217;s door during Chinese New Year, of all time, when I was back in Singapore. The whole situation was so intense that it really messed with my head initially. I did not really know what to feel, except frustration that this pandemic is taking away precious time I have away from my family when I was back in Singapore. First time stepping home in 2 years, and a pandemic has to happen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s funny how I handled the situation, I thought I&#8217;d be more mature after going through all the tribes and tribulations of the education system, the damn army, and university. Clearly, my mental toughness did not meet the mark. I wish I was unfazed by all the chaos that&#8217;s going on, and have a better understanding of what I can control, and what I cannot. These days I try to convince myself that I will be 27 this year (oh my god I will be 27?!), and 10 years down the road I&#8217;d look back at this moment, and tell myself that this was the year that I grew the most, the year that I developed my mental toughness. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Stagnation of deliberate learning</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One aspect of life that has came to a screeching halt has been my deliberate learning. In the past I used to pick up things just for the fun of it. Learn a new web framework, watch some lectures online, read a new book etc. But there&#8217;s just something about being employed that removes that hunger, and thirst for deliberate learning. I acknowledge that this has been left out of my life, and I want to get back into rhythm again. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The masters classes aren&#8217;t supposed to be part of this deliberate learning process, since it is part of what I am supposed to be doing. I&#8217;d like to do deep dives into the latest technologies, get lost in the vast amount of information that overwhelms me when I first discover a particular topic. Chase after that adrenaline rush when making the tiniest bit of progress in mastering a particular topic.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re halfway through 2020, and I believe that there&#8217;s still so much more left to accomplish for the rest of the year. I don&#8217;t want to buy in the idea of &#8220;just take a break we&#8217;re in a pandemic&#8221;. I want to emerge as a better version of myself through these trying times. Here&#8217;s to 3 more semesters of school, mental toughness, and deliberate learning. </p>\n","date":"2020-05-05T04:38:56.000Z"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"mental-toughness"}}}
