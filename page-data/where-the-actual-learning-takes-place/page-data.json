Discuss. This is where the actual learning takes place.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s been three semesters in NUS and I&#8217;ve been studying in solitude for the exams every single time. Perhaps the modules I did the best for were ones that I actively participated in discussions about concepts.</p>\n<p>CS1101S only got slightly more interesting towards the end where I actively discussed with Alex about the concepts. CS1231, CS2100 and CS2020 was fun throughout since Ryan and gang were there for me. Those modules which I did the worse for were those that I did alone, like Calculus and General Biology. For this semester, Computer Networking was a total nightmare that will probably come back to bite me in the ass.</p>\n<p>I remember writing a <a href=\"https://xbili.wordpress.com/2013/12/22/learning-alone-is-really-tough/\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a> way back during army that learning alone is tough. I was struggling with C++. There wasn&#8217;t anybody to direct your concerns to, nor have a casual conversation about concepts and ideas. <strong>True learning takes place best when there is active discussion.</strong></p>\n<p>Maybe this is something I missed out, and I wish I hadn&#8217;t. It is difficult to step out of this bubble that you surrounded yourself with.</p>\n<p>Also, I feel it&#8217;s important to keep myself grounded. Remove myself from the attention that I&#8217;ve been getting lately and focus on personal growth and development. <em>I&#8217;m not that great.</em></p>\n<p>Afterall, glory isn&#8217;t permanent, <strong>skills</strong> are.</p>\n","date":"2015-11-26T06:18:49.000Z"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"where-the-actual-learning-takes-place"}}}
