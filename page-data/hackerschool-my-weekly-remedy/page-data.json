I&#8217;ve been to two sessions so far, learnt some basic git and Expressjs (though I admit I really still suck at Expressjs, gotta play around with it more)</p>\n<p>The past two weeks was really hectic. A parade that included two days of rehearsals, followed by a 4D3N outfield. <strong>The only thing that keeps my mind sane would be the hackerschool workshops every weekend.</strong>Â Just really glad that I have something to do to prevent myself from going insane.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s going to be around 5 more months to ORD, (effectively 3 more, since I&#8217;ll be in the mood during December before the finale in New Zealand once again) and it&#8217;s about time that I pick up even more programming skills. What I currently have would not get me far. I&#8217;ve only learnt very very basic C++, without any functional language which I could create something with. My abilities with HTML/CSS is still really mediocre and I do hope to brush it up.</p>\n<p>The reason why I decided to go for this Express workshop despite not understanding much about HTML/CSS nor web app development is to let myself know how far do I stand among the rest. I know this isn&#8217;t a race nor a &#8220;hunger games among coders&#8221;, but I have no gauge since I&#8217;m just coding by myself most of the time. It&#8217;s good to see that other people are enjoying coding as much as I am.</p>\n<p>Now what am I still lacking? The understanding of how the entire system works. It&#8217;s as though I understand bits and pieces here and there, but I&#8217;m failing to put them all together.</p>\n<p>Well it&#8217;s comforting to know that I still have around a year to tinker around before my school life starts in computing. It&#8217;s competitive, I know, but at the same time, I really enjoy coding. Everytime a code works I feel like a wizard, more like Gandalf.<em> Setting off fireworks while he was still grey.</em></p>\n<p>That&#8217;s about it, I really hope one day, I&#8217;ll look back at my humble beginnings and tell myself&#8230;</p>\n<blockquote><p>Wow, you&#8217;ve come so far!</p></blockquote>\n<p>Keep hacking, ciao!</p>\n","date":"2013-09-14T12:25:19.000Z"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"hackerschool-my-weekly-remedy"}}}
