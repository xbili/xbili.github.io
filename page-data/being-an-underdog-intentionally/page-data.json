I&#8217;ve went through my previous posts (once more) and figured how far I&#8217;ve come, and how long I&#8217;ve waited for this moment. But now that school is really starting, there is an overwhelming sense of loss. </p>\n<h1>It&#8217;s time to be a student again. </h1>\n<p>After a short get together with Hume in the lounge tonight, and a really <strong>subject</strong>ive (haha) conversation about which science is the best, I realise that I used to embrace <strong>studying</strong> in the past. I wasn&#8217;t anything like that when I was younger, but somehow, getting into JJC changed some of that. </p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what I have to convince myself in order to perform at such a peak once more:</p>\n<p><strong>I&#8217;m not at the top, and probably never will. </strong></p>\n<p>Sure, getting into NUS and Tembusu has proven that hard work pays off. I&#8217;m in an environment where people are really smart and hardworking. Almost everyone I meet are either from one of the top JCs or scholars. I&#8217;m an <i>underdog. </i>Not underestimating my own abilities here, but we have to admit that the education we received and the environment we grew up in is very different. </p>\n<p>This <em>underdog </em>feeling is somewhat <strong>motivation</strong> for me to work hard. The constant need to prove to others what you&#8217;re made of, instead of thriving in an environment where everything was built for your success. I think I&#8217;ve written quite a bit about being an underdog previously, and hopefully all that I&#8217;ve reflected on will remain in my head. </p>\n<p><strong>Be an underdog, intentionally.</strong></p>\n<p>Other than that, there&#8217;s the Ponya orientation that&#8217;s taking place next week after lessons. I might just skip some of it, considering that I have basketball trials. Not to say that I&#8217;m worried, but I&#8217;m really concerned about partying and drinking. Two activities which I&#8217;m <strong>not strongly</strong>[1] against. </p>\n<p>Yeah that&#8217;s about it. Let&#8217;s have a first taste of what University life will be like tomorrow! </p>\n<p>[1] I don&#8217;t like excessive drinking and partying, or random drinking and partying. If it&#8217;s for a certain cause, and is justifiable, I wouldn&#8217;t mind it. So long as nobody gets hurt.</p>\n","date":"2014-08-10T15:55:22.000Z"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"being-an-underdog-intentionally"}}}
