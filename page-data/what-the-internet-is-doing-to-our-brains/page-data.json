But well, this video sparked something in me. Maybe this is exactly what&#8217;s stopping me from performing well lately. </p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been on the Internet for way too long&#8230; (And I still am)</p>\n<p>So right now I should probably start working on two of the things which I&#8217;m really passionate about. First, computing. I have no substantial knowledge about computing yet, so it&#8217;ll be a &#8220;start from zero&#8221; kinda thing.</p>\n<p>Next would be my long lost dream for playing basketball. I bought a new ball recently and I do hope to play more in the coming few years. The final few months of my NS and the 4 years I&#8217;ll spend in NUS. </p>\n<p>While at the same time, drastically reducing time wasted on the Internet. Note: I said reducing time <b>wasted</b> on the Internet, not time <b>spent</b> on the Internet. There&#8217;s a difference. What I&#8217;m doing now is time spent, productively, filling my brains with the new knowledge that I&#8217;ve discovered. While wasting time on the Internet is more related to random Facebook refreshes (which I admit, I can&#8217;t stop doing that at times&#8230;)</p>\n<p>Yup, that&#8217;s that, and I&#8217;ll be off!</p>\n","date":"2013-05-31T10:26:08.000Z"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"what-the-internet-is-doing-to-our-brains"}}}
