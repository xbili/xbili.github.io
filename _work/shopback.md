As one of the first few Frontend Engineer interns, I was responsible for the
reimplementation of the front-facing code from PHP templates to Twig templates
for scalability.

During my time at Shopback, I worked closely with senior engineers to ship
features at a rapid pace in a fast growing startup.

I learnt most of my Bootstrap, HTML/CSS + Javascript skills from this
internship and they have proven very useful in my other projects. I also setup
a frontend testing workflow with Mocha and Selenium to ensure that every 
deployment can be done with confidence.
