I developed the company's business metrics visualization tool to aid with
making product decisions. The dashboard was built with Highcharts and React.js.

I also developed [Courier](http://www.askcourier.com), a Facebook
Messenger bot that is powered by [Sift API](http://developer.easilydo.com).
It sends reminders to users when their package has been shipped/arrived.

I am also responsible for several ad-hoc reports that involves complex SQL
queries required by business needs.
