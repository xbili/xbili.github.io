I developed the company's internal business metrics visualization for quick
generation of reports. The dashboard was built with Highcharts and React.js.

I also developed [Courier](www.askcourier.com), a package tracking Facebook
Messenger bot that is powered by [Sift API](developer.easilydo.com). It sends
reminders to users when their package has been shipped/arrived.

I am responsible for several ad-hoc reports required by business needs as well.
