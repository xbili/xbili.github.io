    <p>I participated in my first hackathon yesterday and even though I did not really build something useful or useless, I built something.<!---excerpt-break--></p>

<h1 id="pimory"><a href="http://pimory.herokuapp.com/">Pimory</a></h1>

<p>A friend of mine came up with this idea to build a web version of his <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mampersat.pimorize&amp;hl=en">Pimorize</a>. Originally we were going to do this as a team, but it appears that the idea of staying just to code out the app didn’t appeal to them. So it was left with me, <strong>alone</strong>.</p>

<p>So what does this app do?</p>

<h2 id="it-lets-you-memorize-pi-up-to-9999-digits">It lets you memorize Pi up to 9999 digits.</h2>

<p>Yes, that’s all. It is a very simple app to code out, and I did so in 12 hours. The problem came when I didn’t know what else to do and fatigue just got the better of me. So I went back to Tembusu for bed. (I need my sleep)</p>

<p>The tech stack I decided to use was really simple. An ExpressJS server to read the Pi digits from a .txt file and then jQuery for all of my front-end functionalities. The end result was a bunch of spaghetti code, but it works.</p>

<p>What still bothers me a bit is…
<strong>Why didn’t I use a framework that I’ve learnt</strong></p>

<p>I’ve learnt two of the mostly used front-end frameworks, Angular and Backbone over the holidays, and I did not even think of using them. Initially I thought I wasn’t very familiar with the frameworks, so I didn’t even try. <strong>Bad idea</strong>. Since the app idea was so simple, testing it out with frameworks would be the perfect idea.</p>

<p>But instead of that I opted to use a familiar technology stack. It works, but it’s messy and difficult to extend.</p>

<p>Through the hackathon, I discovered too that my usage of Bootstrap is still very limited. No idea why is that the case, <em>Bootstrap is really user-friendly</em>. Maybe it’s still my web fundamentals that are weak.</p>

<p>Overall, there’s a first-time for everything, and this was my first hackathon. I wouldn’t say it was very successful, considering that I had nothing better to do now that I’m back at Tembusu (readings and problem sets…)</p>

<p>Till next year’s HacknRoll or the next hackathon, there’s much room for improvement!</p>
