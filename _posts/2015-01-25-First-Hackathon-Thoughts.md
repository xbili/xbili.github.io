I participated in my first hackathon yesterday and even though I did not really build something useful or useless, I built something.

[Pimory]
========

A friend of mine came up with this idea to build a web version of his [Pimorize]. Originally we were going to do this as a team, but it appears that the idea of staying just to code out the app didn't appeal to them. So it was left with me, **alone**.

So what does this app do? 

It lets you memorize Pi up to 9999 digits.
------------------------------------------

Yes, that's all. It is a very simple app to code out, and I did so in 12 hours. The problem came when I didn't know what else to do and fatigue just got the better of me. So I went back to Tembusu for bed. (I need my sleep)

The tech stack I decided to use was really simple. An ExpressJS server to read the Pi digits from a .txt file and then jQuery for all of my front-end functionalities. The end result was a bunch of spaghetti code, but it works. 

What still bothers me a bit is...
**Why didn't I use a framework that I've learnt**

I've learnt two of the mostly used front-end frameworks, Angular and Backbone over the holidays, and I did not even think of using them. Initially I thought I wasn't very familiar with the frameworks, so I didn't even try. **Bad idea**. Since the app idea was so simple, testing it out with frameworks would be the perfect idea. 

But instead of that I opted to use a familiar technology stack. It works, but it's messy and difficult to extend. 

Through the hackathon, I discovered too that my usage of Bootstrap is still very limited. No idea why is that the case, *Bootstrap is really user-friendly*. Maybe it's still my web fundamentals that are weak. 

Overall, there's a first-time for everything, and this was my first hackathon. I wouldn't say it was very successful, considering that I had nothing better to do now that I'm back at Tembusu (readings and problem sets...)

Till next year's HacknRoll or the next hackathon, there's much room for improvement!
