I thought that since 2014 is ending, it'll be good to make a list of things that I've learnt in this year. Starting from the very top.

Web Design
==========
Needless to say, I've done quite a bit of web design this year, starting with the first major project that I had. Ecomore's corporate website design has taught me valuable lessons about web design. Things like starting with mobile and image optimization. I don't think there're any better ways of learning these stuff other than **doing it**. 

Check out the final product [here]. I'm still [working on it], so do expect a few bugs here and there. 

AngularJS
=========
I've picked this up while working on Ecomore. It's kind of my way of procrastinating. Having learnt Express and Node, I didn't quite understand what Angular really did. It took me a year to finally grasp the basic concept of Angular, thanks to Code School's Shaping Up with Angular.

Basically, Angular is a web framework which organises your JavaScript code on the *front-end*. In a way, it's taking the **V** and **C** of **MVC** to the front-end. Things that makes Angular much more attractive and user friendly would be directives and services. By utilizing attributes/tags in a HTML5 document, your overall app structure looks much, *much* neater than a long string of jQuery. :3

With that, I progressed to working on a small side project that was created by following a tutorial. You could [check it out].

Functional Programming
======================
All thanks to my module called **CS1101S**, a *SICP inspired introductory programming course*, I've been exposed to functional programming in *JavaScript*. The new style is mind-boggling, but as the course progressed on, I've really taken recursion to be a part of my daily code. Some problems looks much more solvable when we involve recursion. This type of programming methodology would help me with my Algorithm classes next semester. Glad that I scored an **A** for the module.

Other than that, I've been checking out **Immutable.js** by *Facebook*, and trying to find ways to contribute. But... I don't quite understand the code, yet. Didn't take the time to really get down to understanding how does all the code pieces come together. 

Vim
===
This code editor has **not** been part of my toolbox for way too long, and I finally got down to learning it. I found out the best way to do this would be to finish my coding assignments with Vim before copy/pasting it into the online interpreter that we have. 

It worked, and I could use the basic features of Vim very comfortably. Maybe not the advanced Vim ninja stuff yet, but I'll get to that soon enough. 

Python
======
I did very little of this, just for the fun of learning. Took the Python course from Codecademy and found that Python really feels like a *unicorn*. So clean, yet *so powerful*. The neat little scripting skills I picked up from Python would prove itself useful later on.

XML/XSL/EPUB
============
After doing **CS1101S**, I signed up for a 1MC research module, **CS1010R**. I took up the challenge of translating our [online JavaScript SICP] into EPUB. Yes, it is challenging. It requires me to look into quite a bit on XML/XSL and the EPUB format. 

But as it proves, EPUB is a compression of HTML files, images that you want to include, and several meta-data files. So all it requires from me is to change the XSL to create a EPUB friendly HTML file, and generate the meta-data files.

*Generate the meta data files?*

Yes, I did it with my newly acquired **Python** magic. I wrote two neat scripts to generate the *table of contents* and *content.opf* (a manifest that includes all of the EPUB content). 

The latest update as of today, I got the EPUB file working, but it cannot be run by certain readers, there has to be a problem with some of my file formats as eBook readers can be quite strict when it comes down to EPUB file processing. Also, the styling for the HTML files are not included yet. 

There should be a workaround for this via XSL. This is a work in progress. 

Git/Mercurial
=============
Version control is pretty important (duh). I was having a discussion with my dad about version control. Since he works in a broadcasting company, version control is quite important for their systems as well. It was really an "AHA!" moment when I finally could relate to something that was being used in the industry. 

New things I've learnt from Git would definitely be **branching**. Since I've been working by myself most of the time, I have never done `git branch` and `git merge` before. 

So ever since, I've been using Git and GitHub a lot, including my own personal projects. I'll open up issues on GitHub, and name branches after the issue index. It's a productive way of getting things done, considering that I'm solving problems piece by piece, one issue at a time. 

* * *

That's almost everything I've learnt. It has been a great year, and next year I do want to look more into Algorithms. It's going to be the next major module I'm taking in university, and one of the most important concept that any CS student should master. 

Also, **Open Source Projects**. Like I said, I never got down to understanding Immutable.js and contributing to it. So that's something I would love to look into next year. 

Till then, hope everyone had a great 2014, and here's to a better 2015!
