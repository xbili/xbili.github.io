  <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
  <p>My name is Bili, and I am a Computer Science freshman at the <em>National University of Singapore</em>.</p>
  <p>I like to <em>code</em>, a lot. Other non-geeky interests include swimming, basketball and the electric guitar. My personal projects are done in JavaScript. Started off coding in C++. And I'm currently learning Java now for Design Pattern concepts. There are still lots to learn, so do pardon my novice-ness! ^_^</p>
  <p>I talk about stuff <a href="/posts.html">here</a> and <a href="http://xbili.wordpress.com">here.</a></p>

  <h1>Stuff I've done</h1>
  <h3><a href="http://xbili.github.io/hodor-translate">hodor-translate</a></h3>
  <p>Something fun that I did when I'm bored. I'm a really great fan of Game of Thrones, so... You know, we all gotta talk to Hodor someday.</p>
  <h3><a href="http://psinow.herokuapp.com">PSI Now</a></h3>
  <p>I did this when the haze got really bad in Singapore. A one stop website for you find out the current PSI of Singapore. I think it was built more for me to practice some nodejs concepts. :p</p>
  <h3><a href="http://www.ecomorecorp.com">Ecomore Corp Company Website</a></h3>
  <p>I built this after completing my National Service. Built using Twitter Bootstrap, and their Carousel template. Really great experience, though it doesn't look as good as I want it to be. A newer version is coming out <em>soon</em>!</p>
