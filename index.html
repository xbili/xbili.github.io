  <p>My name is Bili, and I am a Computer Science freshman at the <em>National University of Singapore</em>.</p>
  <p>I like to <em>code</em>, a lot. Other non-geeky interests include swimming, basketball and the electric guitar. My personal projects are done in JavaScript. Started off coding in C++. And I'm currently learning Java now for Design Pattern concepts. There are still lots to learn, so do pardon my novice-ness! ^_^</p>
  <p>I talk about stuff <a href="/posts.html">here</a> and <a href="http://xbili.wordpress.com">here.</a></p>
