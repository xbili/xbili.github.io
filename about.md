Hi there!
=========

My name is **Bili** and I am a junior at the **National University of Singapore**, majoring in **Computer Science**.

I am currently a Frontend Engineer Intern at ShopBack.

Coding became a part of my life when I was serving in the military. Due to the large amount of time spent idling in bunks, I brought a book, *C++ Primer*, into camp and started to teach myself how to program. Weekends were then spent tinkering around with the computer at home, and the cycle continued until I completed my conscript service. 

Since then, I've been learning more of **JavaScript** instead of C++ via *Codecademy* and *Code School*. After matriculation, the introductory programming course I opted to take, CS1101S: Programming Methodology, exposed me even more to a functional side of JavaScript. 

Today, I'm still immersing myself in a lot of JavaScript and I don't plan on stopping anytime soon. (Why stop when there's so much to learn?) Here are a few cool things that I've done/am doing:

[NUSMods](https://nusmods.com) (Contributor)
-------------------------------------------
>NUS Modifications (NUSMods) was founded in 2012 by Beng to provide a better way for students to plan their school timetables. Over time, more features have been added to improve the lives of NUS students. Besides timetable planning, NUSMods also serves to be a complete knowledge bank of NUS modules by providing useful module-related information such as archived CORS bidding statistics and community-driven module reviews and discussions.

One of my greatest achievements so far was to work with a larger than usual codebase and actually contributing code for it. Most of my contributions patch small bugs and implement minor improvements. I enjoy learning by doing and hopefully I'll work on more major features in the future :)

You may check out my contributions [here](https://github.com/nusmodifications/nusmods/commits?author=xbili)!

[SICP in JavaScript](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs1101s/sicp/)
---------------------------------------------------------------
As a module fulfillment for CS1010R, I am required to improve our current JavaScript SICP textbook, originally written in Scheme. I've focused on two areas, *an EPUB version of the textbook* and *MathJax support for the textbook*.

Recently I've pivoted to the latter and most of my time is spent on integrating [MathJax](https://mathjax.org) into our current online version of the textbook. 

[Pimory](http://pimory.herokuapp.com)
------------------------------------
**Pimory** was written during Hack&Roll'15 by myself, in order to achieve a noble goal of helping everyone memorize Pi. A friend of mine could memorize Pi up to 700 digits and we thought it'd be a good idea to spread this love for Pi. (Just kidding, we had no better ideas)

Really written just for fun, but some thoughts and lessons learnt from writing a useless app can be found [here]({{site.url}}/2015/01/25/First-Hackathon-Thoughts.html).

[PSINow](http://psinow.herokuapp.com)
------------------------------------
This small but meaningful app was written during the haze season in Singapore. It provides a one-stop web app for people to check the 3-hour PSI (Pollutant Standards Index) without a bloated table of statistics and different scientific terms. 

I did not understand how to use NEA's API back then, so the data for this app is pulled from their Twitter page by making use of Twitter API. I wrote a small parser for the tweets that works fine (most of the time). 

***

I do wish to write more useful things in time to come and be more active in Open Source communities. So far I've not contributed to any major open source projects yet, and I'm working on that. 

Hope you'll have fun reading some of my thoughts and posts here! :)
